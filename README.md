# Boston 311: How Service Requests Have Changed Over Time

Demand for Boston 311 services has grown. In 2024 alone, the city logged nearly 283,000 requests. This represents a **35% increase** since 2015, despite the fact that Bostonâ€™s population declined slightly over that same time period.

But the system is also different in a more fundamental way: the **kinds of issues** that residents are calling about are different. The Transportation Department now has a significantly higher volume of parking enforcement calls, and Public Works, while still the busiest department overall, has shifted somewhat away from sanitation and toward code complaints. And some newer issues, like needle pickup, have also become a regular part of the mix. Geographically, some neighborhoods (especially South Boston) are generating significantly more calls than they were a decade ago.

## What types of requests are driving growth?
1. The single biggest increase came from **Enforcement & Abandoned Vehicles**. Requests in this category rose from around 11,000 in 2015 to around 68,000 in 2024 -- representing about 46% of all growth in the system. Most of this was due to parking enforcement, which experienced nearly 55,000 additional calls over the decade. The Transportation Department, the main entity that handles these requests, saw its overall caseload of transportation issues increase by 230% over the last decade, from around 25,000 to 82,000.

2. The second big driver of the increase was **Code Enforcement,** which had 36,000 more cases in 2024 compared to 2015 (a 98% increase). This includes issues like trash barrels left out improperly (+20,000), poor property conditions (+8,600), unshoveled sidewalks (+3,800), and illegal dumping (+3,000). Code enforcement falls under the Public Works department. This department has always handled a high volume of calls (in fact, the highest of any department) but while it was previously dominated by sanitation, it has shifted toward code enforcement.

3. The third largest driver is the **Needle Program**, which grew from only ~600 calls in 2015 to over 10,000 in 2024, due to needle pickup requests.

Notes: It's possible some growth may stem from changes in how requests are categorized (further research is needed to assess this). Additionally, not every category is increasing -- sanitation, for example, decreased from 34,700 to 10,800, building issues fell from 12,200 to 5,000, and highway maintenance decreased from 27,600 to 22,600. Even within categories that are on the rise, certain sub-categories have declined.

## Which zip codes are driving growth?

Among zip codes with at least 5 requests in 2015, those with the largest % increase over the last decade were 02210 (in Seaport) 02118 (in the South End), and 02127 (in South Boston):

## How quickly are cases closed?

Although the city's caseload is on the rise, Boston appears to be getting faster at closing out cases. In 2015, the median time to close was two days and nine hours. One year later, in 2016, it was 17 hours. In 2024, the median was just 10 hours.  

That said, the overall progress citywide masks big differences between departments:
